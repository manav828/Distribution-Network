# Distribution-Network : Ami Milk
## Project Overview
We are developing an app for the milk industry to improve data flow and speed up order processing. Shopkeepers can place orders through the app, which are then collected by a specific agent and forwarded to the admin. The app also displays order history and allows the admin to manage products, including adding or removing them and changing prices. The database is accessible to the admin for easy modification of the program.

## Development Process


Personal Reflections: I spent a lot of time learning how to use databases and fetch data for this app. I also learned how to create a role-based login system and implement cart functionality. It was exciting to build the app and see it come to life. I enjoyed the process of creating the app and can't believe I did it on my own.I start the app step by step ...

1. Requirements gathering: I began by gathering requirements for the app. I met with stakeholders to understand the current situation, the problems they are facing with data flow, and the specific needs of the milk products industry. I identified the key features, such as the three-tier chain, order submission and tracking, sales tracking, and admin control.

2. Design: Once the requirements were clear, I moved on to designing the app. I created wireframes and prototypes to visualize the user interface and experience. I designed the flow of the app, including how shopkeepers submit orders, how agents collect them, and how the admin controls the database and products.

3. Development: With the design in place, I began developing the app. I used Flutter and Dart to build the app's front-end and back-end components. I integrated Firebase services such as Firestore, Storage, and Authentication to handle data storage and authentication.

4. Testing: Once development was complete, I tested the app thoroughly. This included unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing to ensure that the app works as expected and is easy to use. I also tested the app's performance under different conditions, such as high traffic or slow network connections.

## Usage

The app is designed to facilitate the ordering process for milk products, making it easier for shopkeepers to submit orders and for agents to gather them and present them to the admin. The app provides a history of orders placed and enables the agent and admin to view certain sales. It also features a role-based login system and allows for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database. The app is built using Flutter, Dart, Firebase Firestore, Storage, and Auth.
